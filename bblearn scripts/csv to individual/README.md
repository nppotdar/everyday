Individual marks & comment entry is a painful and time-consuming task on bblearn.
The efficient way of tackling this task thought up by me is in the following format:

Headers:
   <name, first name, last name>, <individual question number, marks obtained and comments for them>

Each tuple contains data for a single student.
You can now use the script to parse the csv in the following way:
 python parse_csv_to_person.py <input_csv_name> > <output_file_name> 

Find the individual organized parsed data in the output data, ready for speedy copy paste into each student's comment entry.

Happy Grading!
